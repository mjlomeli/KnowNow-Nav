# 4. NLP
Place here a description of what your module does. A module is everything in your Web folder.


## 4.1. Writing

Write a very brief description of what your FlaskDriver file does. Maximum 3 sentences.

**Write your public functions here**

* Write about your function, make sure everyone understands how to use it. You don't want people to second 
guess themselves. Then have to look you up to fix their code, but you can't always avoid it. This is your first 
defense against that.

Note: Never write about your private functions. Those functions are generally your helper functions, 
under the hood functions, etc. They are meant to be private and encompass the meaning of encapsulation.

## 4.5.1 More on NLP

Here, write a brief description of what this section is about. Typically in this section you will be 
showing examples of the core functionality. You want to avoid the obvious ones, but include how to start using your program
and any cool tricks you want people to know about using your program. Remember to include how to 
import your program and constructing it if you have to.
