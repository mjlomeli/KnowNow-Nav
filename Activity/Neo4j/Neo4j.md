# 2. Neo4j
Place here a description of what your module does. A module is everything in your Neo4j folder.


## 2.1. Neo4jDriver (name of the .py files)

Write a very brief description of what your Neo4jDriver file does. Maximum 3 sentences.

**Write your public functions here**

* Write about your function, make sure everyone understands how to use it. You don't want people to second 
guess themselves. Then have to look you up to fix their code, but you can't always avoid it. This is your first 
defense against that.

Note: Never write about your private functions. Those functions are generally your helper functions, 
under the hood functions, etc. They are meant to be private and encompass the meaning of encapsulation. 

## 2.1.1 More on Neo4j

Here, write a brief description of what this section is about (you will be showing examples of the core functionality). 
You want to avoid the obvious ones, but include how to start it and any cool tricks you want people to know about 
using your program. Remember to include how to import your program and constructing it if you have to.
