She had her biopsy last week and the results show there are cancer cells on her lymph nodes. She was told the next step may be radiation or chemotheraphy,,,,,,,,,,,,"After the mastectomy the pathologist will look at the tumor closely. Staging might change because it partly depends on the maximum size of the tumor and sometimes the mammograms/ultrasounds are not as precise. After the surgery, patient will probably have drains - tubes stitched or taped into the skin, to help drain fluid/blood from the incision. She may need to sleep upright for a bit & she will need some help around the house. Pain is usually well managed with medication. Decisions regarding chemotherapy are based on how aggressive the tumor is, its spread, its response to hormonal treatments, and the patient's ability to tolerate chemo side effects. Depending on her hormonal receptor status, she may also qualify for something called OncotypeDX where they analyze the tumor and try to predict its risk of recurrence. That can also help with the decision to pursue or skip chemo. Radiation is what is used in the area to kill any cells that might escape surgery. It tends to cause fatigue and skin damage but is by most accounts easier to deal with than chemo.",Zihan Zheng,https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/145/topics/862596,,,,,,,,
